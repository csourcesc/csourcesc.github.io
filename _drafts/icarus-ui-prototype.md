We have started thinking about the future of CatSource, since, let's agree, the current site isn't really well made, and requires an email, which Scratch Team doesn't really appreciate.

I, Locness, started making a design concept.

[View the prototype](https://icarus-ui-test.glitch.me)

* **July 12, 2018** : Added ***header autohide***

* **July 29, 2018** : Edited dropdown animation

* **August 30, 2018** : Almost fully switched to material design (missing notifications dropdown)

* **September 1, 2018** : Added fake login

* **September 21, 2018** : Some changes so that you can go back to top on iOS using the status bar.

* **December 5, 2018** : We are now using the [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) CSS framework.

* **December 15, 2018** : Some effect on sprite cards hover

* **The prototype has moved to Glitch, since Thimble is shutting down.**

* **December 22, 2018** : Improved accessibility (so color change)
