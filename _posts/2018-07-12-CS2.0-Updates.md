So, Locness has been working on a design project for CatSource 2.0 which can be seen down below.
![The design]({{site.baseurl}}/images/csourcedesign.png)  
As you can see we are switching to a more modern and intuitive interface.

We're wanting people to help if they know PHP.

- **June 30, 2018** : Locness made a prototype interface,updated regularly, which isn't dynamicÂ [here](https://thimbleprojects.org/locness/511071).

- **July 12, 2018** : Added **_header autohide_**

- **July 29, 2018** : Edited dropdown animation

- **August 30, 2018** : Almost fully switched to material design (missing notifications dropdown)

- **September 1, 2018** : Added fake login

- **September 21, 2018** : Some changes so that you can go back to top on iOS using the status bar.

_We update this post regularly_
