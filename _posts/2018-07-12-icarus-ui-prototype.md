We have started thinking about the future of CatSource, since, let's agree, the current site isn't really well made, and requires an email, which Scratch Team doesn't really appreciate.

I, Locness, started making a design concept.

Now, I made a prototype interface (so it doesn't work), which can be seen [here](https://icarus-ui-test.glitch.me). Please give feedback on Framavox, or on the [Padlet](https://padlet.com/csource/main)  if you don't have / don't want to give an email (We totally respect your choice, and will never focus more on Framavox messages than Padlet ones or vice versa)
